# Dijkstra Shortest Path

## Meet the Algorithms

**Dijkstra** (weighted): The OG guarantees the shortest path

<b>A\* Search</b> (weighted): Arguably the best pathfinding algorithm which uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Shortest Path

## Usage

### Start, Destination and Walls

- Left click to set the start, destination and walls
- Right click to undo a vertex

### Reset

- Press **c** reset all vertices

### Algorithm

- Press **a** to start the A\* search algorithm
- Press **d** to start Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

### Maze

- Press **m** to generate a random maze

## Requirements

- python >= 3.9
- pygame
