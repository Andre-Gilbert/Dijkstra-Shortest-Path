# Dijkstra Shortest Path

## Meet the Algorithms

**Dijkstra** (weighted): <br/>
The OG pathfinding algorithm which guarantees the shortest path.

<b>A\* Search</b> (weighted): <br/>
Arguably the best pathfinding algorithm which uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Shortest Path.

## Usage

- Left click to set the start, destination and walls
- Right click to undo a vertex
- Press **c** to reset all vertices
- Press **a** to start the A\* search algorithm
- Press **d** to start Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- Press **m** to generate a random maze

## Requirements

- python >= 3.9
- pygame
